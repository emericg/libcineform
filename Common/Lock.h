/*!
	@brief Lock access to a critical section with automatic unlocking

	Acquire access to a critical section and relinquish access when the
	class instance is destroyed.  The typical use case is to allocate an
	instance of this class on the stack so that the lock is automatically
	relinquished when enclosing lexical scope is released.

	Future versions may support automatic unlocking of other types of locks.
	In this case, the constructor and member variable should be changed to
	accept the base class for all locks as an argument.
